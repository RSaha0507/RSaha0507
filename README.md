- 👋 Hello everyone, I’m Rounak Saha - presently a 3rd year CS student at NIT Meghalaya.
- 👀 I’m a passionate explorer in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Networks and have gained more or less some skills over the course of my academic years.
- 🌱 Speaking of extra-curriculars - story-wrting as well as story-telling, exploring the other side of religions and what many people don't want to listen - occultism
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate mostly on Software Systems making use of AI and ML concepts for various applications.
- 📫 How to reach me - contact me at rs574.cs008@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I kinda take interest in doing minor or major projects but my genuine interest lies in exploring occultism and religious other sides.
